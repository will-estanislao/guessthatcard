                    Telekinesis, telepathy, and clairvoyance. Extrasensory perception beyond the
                    5 physical senses of taste, touch, smell, sight and hearing. Is it possible to
                    measure psychic abilities?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 1930s, J.B. Rhine attempted to measure ESP through experiments. He used
                    Zener cards to test ones psychic abilities, specifically telepathy.

                <p>
                    The experiment consists of a sender and receiver. The sender views the cards, 
                    while the receiver guesses the symbols.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, measuring psychic abilities with Zener cards proved to be inconclusive.
                    Subjects were able to cheat the test by seeing reading the experimenter's expressions,
                    discerning symbols through indentation on the back of cards, or through a reflection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ESP and paranormal research are classified as pseudosciences.

                <p>
                    The Zener card designs are made up of a circle, cross, wave, square and a star. A deck
                    of Zener cards are made up of 25 cards with 5 of each symbol. The name of the
                    cards originates from Karl Zener, a perceptual psychologist who worked with J.B. Rhine.
